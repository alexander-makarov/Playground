# Playground
Playground is a project with a bunch of study cases that explore different .NET language features and peculiarities.
You would find here some amusing code examples from job interview tests, books (like CLR Via C# by J. Richter) and blogs. Recommended usage is as follows: 
*  pick up one of the study cases, go to the code and explore without running it first 
*  once you made your mind on how the code is expected to work, run the study case code by uncommenting it in Program.cs and check whether your expectation and understanding were correct ;)
